# Block Volume Lab

**Objective:**  
This lab covers the creation and attachment of a Block Volume to a virtual machine instance in OCI and verifies storage configuration and mounting.

**Key Steps:**
- Create a Block Volume from the OCI Console
- Attach the volume to a Compute Instance
- Format, mount, and use the volume in Linux (using Cloud Shell)
- Test data persistence

**Files Included:**
- `instructions.docx` — Step-by-step lab instructions
- `block-volume-setup.md` — Markdown notes about volume creation and partitioning
- `attach-volume.sh` — Shell script to automate volume attachment and mounting
- `block-volume-diagram.png` — Visual snapshot of instance and volume relationship
- `test-results.txt` — Output from mount and write tests on the compute instance

**Cloud Skills Demonstrated:**
- Persistent block storage provisioning
- Linux disk formatting and mounting
- OCI storage and compute integration
- Infrastructure automation via script
